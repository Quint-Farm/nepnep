## Notable progress.

##### Server
- You can now mention every member's color role.
- Updated play schedule. SAT & SUN, optional Friday. Check events calendar above #play for more info.

##### Nepabella
- "-help" for Nepabella's commands.
	Notable commands for Group:
	- "-weekplay Note?": Pings & request for a weekday or weekplay schedule, words following weekplay is copied by Nep and put in a parenthesis as notes.
		Not putting notes still posts the same weekplay request.
		Won't remove pings for now, ruu will just know if it's a bad idea.

- Sets status to playing Stardew Valley when invite code is given or a game session is happening.
- Neps' DMS can now fully be viewed by ruu like images, unless Nep is offline.
- Mentions of Nepabella, makes them react & send messages. Say hi to Nepabella!
- Command cooldowns, some have 30 minute cooldowns like pings.
- "https://github.com/Quint-Farm/Nepabella", is the repository but won't open for now.

### New changelog
- Role order in member list no longer seperates 1st gen/wave from other gen/wave. (Now arranged by actual online meaning participation & interaction time, invisible, not seeing pings or messages, & ghosting not counted despite online.)

### Future ideas- 
- Role order of ruu when prep schedule & post pone schedule.
